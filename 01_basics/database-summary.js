/* //  Two categories of datatypes: Primitive and Non- Primitive(Reference type)

//Primitive datatypes (call by value types) (Primitve datatypes have 7 types :)
1. String : has characters (alphabets, numerals, symbols)
2. Numbers : contains numerical values
3. BigInt : contains huge number value. used for scientific values where there are very big numbers
4. Undefined : data is not defined but variable is assigned
5. null : has standalone value / Empty value (for ex: yadi temp app se current temp fetch karna hai aur 
    temp app me error ya server error ke karan value 0 aati hai to temp 0 nahi hua That means the return value 
    should be null/empty)
6. boolean: true or false
7. symbol: to make any component unique. Majorly usedin React js

//Non-primitive datatypes or Reference type :
1. array
2. object (to master javascript one can learn all concepts of objects and browser web events)
3. funcitons

Q. is javascript static typed or dynamically typed language?
A. Javascript is dynamically typed language which means datatypes of variables are determinded by the
    values assigned to them or the values they hold at runtime. And the values can be changed during
    throughout the program.
